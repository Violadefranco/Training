Overview

This repository contains multiple Python scripts designed for learning and practicing fundamental programming concepts. Each script serves a different educational purpose, such as working with arrays, mathematical operations, and logic-based conditions.

Included Scripts

ORDINA IN MODO CRESCENTE - Sorts three integers in ascending order using conditional swaps.

SCAMBIO 2 NUMERI - Demonstrates swapping two numbers.

QUOZIENTE RESTO 14-3 - Computes the quotient and remainder of division.

TAVOLA PITAGORICA - Generates a multiplication table up to 12x12.

TAVOLA PITAGORICA CON INPUT - Allows user input to generate a multiplication table of custom size.

STAMPA ARRAY - Prints elements of a predefined array.

STAMPA ARRAY DA INPUT - Takes user input to fill and print an array.

STAMPA ARRAY AL CONTRARIO - Prints an array in reverse order.

TROVA MAX, MIN E MEAN - Finds the maximum, minimum, and mean of a user-defined array.

BATTAGLIA NAVALE - Simulates a simple battleship game with a 10x10 grid.

How to Run

Each script is standalone and can be executed using Python 3. Simply run:

python script_name.py

Replace script_name.py with the actual filename.

Learning Objectives

Understanding loops, conditionals, and input handling.

Practicing array operations and basic algorithms.

Implementing mathematical logic in Python.
